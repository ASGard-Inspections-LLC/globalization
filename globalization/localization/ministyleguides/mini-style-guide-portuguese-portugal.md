# Top 10 Tips for Microsoft Translation into Portuguese (Portugal)

You are helping with translation into Portuguese (Portugal), but don't have time to study all aspects of the Portuguese (Portugal) Style Guide on the [Microsoft Language Portal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Language/StyleGuides)? Here are ten of the most important aspects to keep in mind.

## 1.	Translate sense not words

If a translated sentence is hard to understand or incomprehensible to you (or anyone else), it is likely that you did not understand it. Always make sure that you understand every single word in the source text, and research how the same things are said in Portugal.

When a glossary term is very generic, try to expand the translation slightly to make your translation unambiguous. For example, translate _drive_ simply as a unit does not always convey an unambiguous meaning. In such cases, consider translating it as <span lang="pt-PT">_unidade de disco_, _unidade de banda_, _unidade USB_</span>—whatever is applicable to the scenario at hand.

To search for terms only on European Portuguese websites, add "site:.pt" to your search string in the browser.

Words to watch out for: 

|English|Portuguese (Portugal)|
|---|---|
|character|<span lang="pt-PT">caráter</span>|
|characters|<span lang="pt-PT">carateres</span>|
|convert to|<span lang="pt-PT">converter em</span>|
|display|<span lang="pt-PT">mostrar</span> (what the computer displays to the user)
| |<span lang="pt-PT">visualizar</span> (what the user sees on the computer)|
|download|<span lang="pt-PT">transferir</span>|
|make sure|<span lang="pt-PT">certifique-se de que</span>|
|please|[omit]|
|required|<span lang="pt-PT">necessário</span>|
|set to|<span lang="pt-PT">definir como</span>|
|website|<span lang="pt-PT">site</span>|

## 2.	Spelling

Post-reform European Portuguese spelling rules apply.

As regards dual-spelling words, apply the spelling that reflects standard European Portuguese (Lisbon) pronunciation. In cases where dual spelling is dictionarised for standard Portuguese (Portugal) pronunciation, e.g., the translation of character, refer to the approved glossaries.

## 3.	Capitalization

Follow the source text capitalisation style regarding Title Case and Sentence case. 

**Example**

_Translate this_: Do not use Print Without Saving so as not to lose your work.

_With this_: <span lang="pt-PT">Não use a opção Imprimir Sem Guardar para não perder o seu trabalho.</span>

When a single source word translates into multiple target words (e.g., Desktop), make sure to capitalise all applicable words (<span lang="pt-PT">Ambiente de Trabalho</span>).

## 4.	Acronyms	

For the plural form of acronyms, add a lower-case "s". 

**Example**

|English|Portuguese|
|---|---|
|Insert the CD.|<span lang="pt-PT">Insira o CD.</span>|
|Insert the CDs.|<span lang="pt-PT">Insira os CDs.</span>|
|Insert a CD.|<span lang="pt-PT">Insira um CD.</span>|
|Insert CDs.|<span lang="pt-PT">Insira CDs.</span>|

## 5.	Audience

All audiences must be addressed using formal wording (verb in 3rd person singular). However, gaming audiences are to be addressed informally (2nd person singular).

## 6.	Preposition (<span lang="pt-PT">regência verbal</span>)

**Example**

|Source text|Incorrect|Correct|
|---|---|---|
|convert (sth.) to|<span lang="pt-PT">converter para</span>|<span lang="pt-PT">converter em</span>|
|register (sth.) with|<span lang="pt-PT">registar com</span>|<span lang="pt-PT">registar em</span>|
|set (sth.) to|<span lang="pt-PT">definir para</span>|<span lang="pt-PT">definir como</span>|

## 7.	Possessive Pronouns

Only translate the possessive pronouns his/her/its and their as _respetivo(s)_ when the intended meaning is indeed corresponding. While some translators believe this is common practice, more often than not it results in the conveyance of incorrect or ambiguous translation. Simply use _seu(s)_ or _sua(s)_ whenever this allows for conveying unambiguous meaning, otherwise use _dele(s)_ or _dela(s)_. Note that ambiguous translations are penalized in reviews.

## 8.	Quotation Marks

End-of-sentence marks such as periods, question marks, etc. in a sentence with a quotation, but that are not part of the quotation, must be placed outside the question marks.

## 9.	Numbers

When translating large numbers, please remember that English (US), Portuguese (Brazil) and Portuguese (Portugal) number names differ greatly. 

**Example**

|English (US)|Portuguese (Brazil)|Portuguese (Portugal)|
|---|---|---|
|million|<span lang="pt-BR">milhão</span>|<span lang="pt-PT">milhão</span>|
|billion|<span lang="pt-BR">bilião</span>|<span lang="pt-PT">mil milhões</span>|
|trillion|<span lang="pt-BR">trilião</span>|<span lang="pt-PT">bilião</span>|

As regards separators, the decimal separator is a comma, and the thousands separator is a period.  Example: 20.356,51.

## 10.	 Infinitive vs. Imperative

All **Instructions** to the user must be translated using the **Imperative** (<span lang="pt-PT">faça</span>), and not the infinitive (<span lang="pt-PT">fazer</span>). For instance, a dialog box presents the user with the following instructions:

|English|Portuguese|
|---|---|
|Open the file to edit its contents.|<span lang="pt-PT">Abra o ficheiro para editar o conteúdo.</span>|
|Close the file to continue|<span lang="pt-PT">Feche o ficheiro para continuar</span>|

All **Commands** from the user to the software as well as all **Descriptions** of commands, keystroke functions, etc., must be translated using the **Infinitive** (<span lang="pt-PT">fazer</span>). Examples of commands:

|English|Portuguese|
|---|---|
|Open file to edit contents|<span lang="pt-PT">Abrir ficheiro para editar conteúdo</span>|
|Open the file and edit contents.|<span lang="pt-PT">Abrir ficheiro e editar conteúdo.</span>|
|Open\nOpen file in Excel|<span lang="pt-PT">Open\nAbrir ficheiro no Excel</span>|

Examples of descriptions:

|English|Portuguese|
|---|---|
|Open\nOpen file in Excel|<span lang="pt-PT">Open\nAbrir ficheiro no Excel</span>|
|/QUERY Query current session login mode.\n|<span lang="pt-PT">/QUERY Consultar o modo atual de início de sessão.\n</span>|
|Enable, disable, or drain session logins.\n\n|<span lang="pt-PT">Ativar, desativar ou drenar inícios de sessão.\n\n</span>|
|PAGE UP\tMove 3 lines up in the text|<span lang="pt-PT">PAGE UP\tSubir 3 linhas no texto</span>|
