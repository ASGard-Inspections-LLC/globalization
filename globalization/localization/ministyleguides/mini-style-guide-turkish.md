# Top 10 Tips for Microsoft Translation into Turkish

You are helping with translation into Turkish, but don't have time to study all aspects of the Turkish Style Guide on the [Microsoft Language Portal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Language/StyleGuides)? Here are ten of the most important aspects to keep in mind.

## 1.	Adapt, don't follow

Word for word approach rarely works in translation. The key point is to deliver the right meaning and intent with a natural tone while using correct and consistent terminology for each product. Review the source carefully and communicate its meaning in the translated text, not just the individual words.

You may need to add words to give the intended meaning, or omit words or phrases that make the text unnecessarily longer. The important thing is to capture the essence of the original, and reflect it in Turkish. As if it were written in Turkish in the first place!

## 2.	English words may not be appropriate

English words may be a part of life in multinational companies or among developers. However, the target audience of Microsoft products also includes novice users or less experienced consumers from every aspect of life—such as students and teachers, small business owners, and government workers. This audience may not be familiar with those English words and their pronunciations. Always check references for established Turkish translations of common terms.

Product and feature names may also be localized, but some of them are left in English. Be sure to check the references.

## 3.	Use Microsoft standard terminology

The [Microsoft Language Portal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Language/StyleGuides) is an extensive resource of terms used in wide range of products. Always check it for key Turkish terms used the Microsoft products and features. Deviating from established terms in the product may confuse users.

## 4.	Clarity is the key

Short and clear sentences are easier to understand. Be brief. Avoid using heavily-inflected long words, complex structures, and chaining several nouns together. Use modern and well-known words.

**Example**

TBD

In the case some part of the source text is unclear, or more than one interpretation is possible, check the Instructions or Comments provided with the translation file. Support articles and product pages from Microsoft also present detailed information. Make an online search to better understand or clarify the context and avoid vague translations. 

## 5.	Microsoft Voice

[Microsoft Voice](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human) avoids an unnecessarily formal tone. The general style should be clear, friendly and concise. Avoid slang and be careful with colloquialisms.

Microsoft Voice allows for the use of culture-centric colloquialisms, idioms and metaphors (collectively referred to "colloquialisms").

*	Do not replace the source colloquialism with a Turkish colloquialism unless it is a perfect and natural fit for that context.
*	Translate the intended meaning of the colloquialism in the source text, but only if the colloquialism's meaning is an integral part of the text that can't be omitted.
*	If the colloquialism can be omitted without affecting the meaning of the text, omit it.

**Example**

Aww, we love our users, too bad we can't keep in touch.
_Not our style_: <span lang="tr">Ayy, kullanıcılarımızı çok severiz. Sizinle iletişim kuramayacak mıyız?</span>
_Our style_: <span lang="tr">Kullanıcılarımızla iletişimde olmayı seviyoruz. Bunu yapamayacağımıza üzüldük.</span>

## 6.	Pronouns

Use personal pronouns instead of passive voice. Third-person references, such as "user," should be avoided as they sound formal and impersonal. When the source uses the first person plural ("we"), consider following the same structure in Turkish to preserve the informal tone and give the sense of speaking to the user.

**Example**

_Translate this_: Please wait and we'll let you know when this is done.

_With this_: <span lang="tr">Lütfen bekleyin. İşlem tamamlandığında haber vereceğiz.</span>

Omitting pronouns is a common mistake in Turkish translations. At the same time, overusing them might negatively affect understanding. In some cases, pronouns can be rendered as neutral subjects, but to do this, the subject of the sentence should be clear. To make the sentence more understandable, you should consider simplifying it.

**Example**

_Not our style_: <span lang="tr">Cümlenin daha anlaşılır olması için bunu sadeleştirmelisiniz.</span>

_Our style_: <span lang="tr">Daha anlaşılır olması için cümleyi sadeleştirmelisiniz.</span>

## 7.	Grammar choices for a natural tone

The conjunctive "and" is not as frequently used in Turkish. It may be replaced with a comma or omitted if possible.

**Example**

Remove one or more recipients and try again.

_Not our style_: <span lang="tr">Bir veya daha fazla alıcıyı silin ve tekrar deneyin.</span>

_Our style_: <span lang="tr">Bir veya daha fazla alıcıyı silip tekrar deneyin.</span>

Contractions help to keep things neat. Avoid using separate words for "eğer", "ise", "ile", etc.

**Example**

_Not our style_: <span lang="tr">Eğer bu öğeyi siler iseniz buradaki araç ile görüntüleyemezsiniz.</span>

_Our style_: <span lang="tr">Bu öğeyi silerseniz buradaki araçla görüntüleyemezsiniz.</span>

## 8.	Translations of "You", "Please", and "Sorry"

Users are addressed in the second person plural, "siz." Verbs also should be in the second person plural form of "yapın," not the extremely polite (and old-fashioned) form "yapınız."

Turkish does not use "please" or "sorry" as much as English. Use "please" when the user is asked to do something inconvenient, is asked to wait, or is inconvenienced by the software. Use "sorry" only in error messages that result in serious problems for the customer, or when a product, or service fails.

More than one alternative exists in Turkish for the term "sorry." "Özür dileriz" for serious problems, and "ne yazık ki" or "maalesef" in less severe cases. Sometimes it is best to avoid it because it is too much in Turkish. "Üzgünüz" is not a good option; it conveys that the material has been translated.

## 9.	Different language, different punctuation rules

Punctuation rules in Turkish are quite different from English. So, transferring punctuation marks into the translation is not a good idea. 

For example, em-dashes or long dashes (—) are not used as separators in Turkish, so they should be replaced with commas, colons, or parentheses, whichever applicable or removed. Similarly, the ampersand ("&") does not mean "and" in Turkish and should be replaced with "ve."

## 10.	Avoid double spaces and mixed capitalization

Use sentence case by default (that is, only the first letter in the line is capitalized). Only proper nouns such as product names and references to user interface items are capitalized in the middle of a sentence.

Avoid double-spaces after full-stops and between words—even if the source has them!
