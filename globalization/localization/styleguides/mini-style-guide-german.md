# Top 10 Tips for Microsoft Translation into German

You are helping with translation into German, but don't have time to study all aspects of the German Style Guide on the [Microsoft Language Portal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Language/StyleGuides)? Here are ten of the most important aspects to keep in mind.

## 1.	Translate sense not words

The language in Microsoft products should have the "feel" of a product originally written in German, using idiomatic syntax and terminology, while at the same time maintaining a high level of consistency. That guarantees the maximum user experience and usability for our customers. Sticking too closely to the original text will make it sound unnatural. Use correct technical terminology but express the sense you got from the source text as if you were writing in German. Then, read your translation out aloud to check whether it sounds like something you would say in German.

**Example**

Compose your vision within the cloud

_Our style_: <span lang="de">Lassen Sie Ihrer Kreativität freien Lauf.</span>

_Not our style_: <span lang="de">Realisieren Sie in der Cloud Ihre Vision.</span>

## 2.	Keep product names in English

There is no need to leave a term in English, if a good German term is available. To be clear, a good number of German IT terms are borrowed from English (e.g. Server, Client, Agent). But when available, give preference to German native terms. That makes a text more user-friendly and gives access to users who are not familiar with loanwords.

**Example**

_English_: upload → _German_: <span lang="de">hochladen</span> (_Not_: <span lang="de">uploaden</span>)

_English_: firstline worker → _German_: <span lang="de">Mitarbeiter in Service und Produktion</span>

This is a rough rule: [Trademarked names](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/en-us.aspx) and the name Microsoft Corporation often remain in English, unless an approved German name for the trademark is available. Application, product and sometimes even feature names may be trademarked and therefore often remain in English. Check the [Microsoft Language Portal](http://www.microsoft.com/language), or contact the moderator if there is any doubt.

**Example**

_English_: Microsoft Office 365 Developer Technical Preview → _German_: <span lang="de">Microsoft Office 365 Developer Technical Preview</span>

_English_: Windows Desktop Application Program → _German_: <span lang="de">Windows-Desktopanwendungsprogramm</span>

## 3.	Follow the tone and style of the English original

[Microsoft voice](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human) targets a broad set of users from technology enthusiasts to casual computer users. Translating Microsoft's voice into German means choosing words and grammatical structures that reflect the same style as the source text. But it also means considering the needs of the audience and the intent of the text. In general, the style should be clear and friendly. Be concise without sounding robot-like.

**Example**

_Translate this warning_: Invalid ID

_With this_: <span lang="de">Ihre ID sollte folgende Form haben: someone@example.com.</span> 

## 4.	Choose gender-neutral language

Regardless of the audience, avoid gender stereotypes and aim to be as gender-neutral as possible. For example, instead of using phrases which specifically mention genders, use general language that includes all genders. A good solution is the use of the plural or abstraction (e.g. <span lang="de">-Arbeitskraft, Schulungspersonal, Fachhilfe</span>). Where gender specificity cannot be avoided without sounding awkward, choose inclusive language to cover all genders.

**Example**

_Our style_: <span lang="de">Sie erhalten möglicherweise keine Antwort, da dieser Kontakt den Status "Abwesend" hat.</span>

_Not our style_: <span lang="de">Diese(r) Empfänger(in) antwortet möglicherweise nicht, da er/sie den Status "Abwesend" hat.</span>

When you use gender-neutral pronouns (e.g. <span lang="de">man, jemand, niemand, wer</span>), be consistent and follow through. 

**Example**

_Our style_: <span lang="de">Niemand darf aufgrund seines Alters benachteiligt werden.</span>

_Not our style_: <span lang="de">Niemand darf aufgrund des Alters benachteiligt werden.</span>

Passive voice is a typical aspect of the German language. While Microsoft style is active, passive voice can be used to achieve gender-neutral language.

**Example**

_Our style_: With this: <span lang="de">Es ist folgendes zu beachten.</span>

_Not our style_: <span lang="de">Der Benutzer der Software sollte folgendes beachten.</span>

If the text is about an individual and the gender is clear, be specific.

**Example**

_Our style_: <span lang="de">Erika Müller ist Personalchefin. Sie ist unsere Expertin in Sachen Personal.</span>

In short texts or text strings, for titles or when a group is composed of women and men, make conscious choices. Acceptable approaches are camel casing (e.g. <span lang="de">DoktorandIn</span>) and slash (e.g. <span lang="de">Entwickler/in</span>). Do not use an underscore (e.g. <span lang="de">Mitarbeiter_innen</span>).

## 5.	Follow English pronouns, but adapt to German style

The use of personal pronouns is a powerful way to express all the attributes of the Microsoft voice. Third-person references, such as "user," are avoided as they sound formal and impersonal. The German Microsoft voice follows the usage of the en-US voice if this does not impact grammar or create redundancy. Addressing the user by first-person or second-person pronouns conveys the meaning that this person is not anonymous. The usage of "<span lang="de">wir</span>" (we) generates the image of a team behind the software who cares about what the user is doing.

In technical contexts, the use of "we" might sound too personal in German and might need to be replaced by a more neutral translation even if "we" is used in the source text. Always check use of pronouns in context.

**Example**

_English_: Answer a few simple questions and we'll help you choose.

_German_: <span lang="de">Beantworten Sie uns ein paar Fragen und wir helfen Ihnen bei der Auswahl.</span>

## 6.	Strike the right formality

German is a more formal language. Most notably, we have the formal (<span lang="de">Sie</span>) and the informal way (<span lang="de">Du</span>) of addressing people. It has become more common to address others with the informal <span lang="de">Du</span>, particularly in advertisements or gaming contexts. While Microsoft's voice is generally on the less formal side, consistency is important. To assure that all translators use the same approach, we recommend using Sie unless you are addressing children under 18.

**Example**

_Our style_: <span lang="de">Sie bestimmen, wann neue Updates installiert werden sollen.</span>

## 7.	Break up long compounds

Compounds should be understandable and clear. Overly long or complex compounds (e.g. <span lang="de">.NET Framework Windows-Ressourcenlokalisierungs-Editor</span>) should be avoided. Keep in mind that unintuitive compounds are a usability issue.

The Microsoft standard is that German compounds of three components or fewer are spelt as one word, unless the compound is ambiguous, or the software design requires hyphenation. Compounds made up of German and English components are often hyphenated to avoid readability problems. Use Duden guidelines.

Product names that consist of multiple words are not hyphenated for legal reasons. A hyphen is placed between a product name and a term to set the product name off from the word that follows in a compound. This rule applies even if the word that follows is an English term. The only exception is a product name directly followed by the term "Setup," because Setup is treated like a product name.

**Example**

_English_: home page file name → German: <span lang="de">Homepage-Dateiname</span>

_English_: Skype Manager Administrator → German: <span lang="de">Skype Manager-Administrator</span>

_English_: Office Setup Assistant → German: <span lang="de">Office-Setup-Assistent</span>

## 8.	Avoid abbreviations

English texts generally have a high number of abbreviations. German uses fewer abbreviations to begin with. We often can't avoid using acronyms and other short forms because space on the interface is limited. Unless they are very well known or even the preferred term (e.g. WLAN, DVD), use the full forms. It enhances readability and understanding. Do not invent new abbreviations.

**Example**

_English_: VCR → German: <span lang="de">Videorekorder</span> (_Not_: VCR)

## 9.	Use <span lang="de">ß</span> where appropriate

The letter <span lang="de">ẞ</span> (<span lang="de">ß – ẞ</span>) is now an official letter in German orthography. Use it to replace the capital "SS" in words that are written in capital letters.

**Example**

_English_: STREET → _German_: <span lang="de">STRAẞE</span> (not: <span lang="de">STRASSE</span>)

## 10.	Use the right reference material

There is more, of course. If you are in doubt, consult the terminology, translation, and full [German Style Guide](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/language) and the following references:
